## Abstract

As more and more people prefer to stay at airbnb accommodation rather than staying at fancy hotels, the demand for airbnb has increased over time. Due to this demand more people are investing in houses to rent on Airbnb. Investors need to know which property to invest in to get high return on investment.

## How to explore this project

The main file is  `airbnb_analysis.ipynb` notebook. It contains step by step implementation of causal inference on ROI of any investment listed on airbnb 

Necessary api to collect the data are as follows :
1. [Here Maps](https://developer.here.com/)
1. [Walkscore.com](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/walk-score-apis.php)
1. [greatschools.com](https://www.greatschools.org/api/request-api-key)

The data collected by our team is in the folder `Data`
We have done the analysis and testing of the models in R and Python Languages.
Analysis.ipynb is the python notebook and
Global Markov & Failthfulness.ipynb is the code in R
